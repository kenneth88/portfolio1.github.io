            <h2>My name is Jorge Chinchilla and I am a student at <a class="uppercase" href="http://phs.pasadenausd.org/"> Phs</a>.</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Junior at PHS and this is my first year here.

                I enjoy playing video games and listening to music.
                I am more often than not oblivious to my surroundings.
